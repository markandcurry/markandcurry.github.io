                    <p><strong>TRUCKEE, Calif.</strong> – <em><strong>March 28, 2012</strong></em> – Clear Capital (<a href="http://www.clearcapital.com">www.clearcapital.com</a>), a leading provider of data and solutions for commercial and residential real estate asset valuations, announced today the availability of ClearQC™, a fully-hosted service to automate the review of BPO and appraisal reports. The system brings new levels of speed and intelligence to the valuation review process, with refined business rules and multiple data perspectives to create the most progressive automated review service available from any vendor.</p>
                    <p>ClearQC finds the “needles in the haystacks” for internal review teams. It allows loan originators, servicers, and investors to run all of their valuation reports from any provider through an automated process to highlight complete and well supported valuations, and also flag those needing further attention.</p>

                <div id="release1Rest">
                    <p> “To ensure our appraisals and BPOs consistently lead the market in quality, we’ve spent the last decade developing and refining an advanced internal system to analyze our own valuations prior to human review,” said Kevin Marshall, President and Co-Founder of Clear Capital. “We were frequently asked by clients if we could run non-Clear Capital valuations through our system as they recognized the lift in quality that ClearQC provides. Now for the first time, we are excited to offer these automated review technologies directly to our customers as a hosted service for any BPO or appraisal, helping create a much more powerful and efficient review process.”</p>
                    <p> ClearQC’s advanced rules evaluate areas of the report such as selection of comparables, price conclusions, the effect of market trends, and the completeness and validity of data. The company provides a full set of pre-defined rules based on best practices learned over a decade of valuation experience, and will also work with customers to develop customized sets of rules to meet their specific business needs.</p>
                    <p> The data used by ClearQC to support the analysis includes MLS data, including sales and listings data, public records, Clear Capital’s HDI™ (Home Data Index) market data, and the company’s proprietary market and comparable database built up over 11 years. This data powers evaluations of value ranges, selection of comparables, and appropriate vendor proximities and behaviors.</p>
                    <p> “Our mission has always been to provide confidence. ClearQC lives up to that mission by giving our client’s confidence that they are spending the time reviewing the loans that have the highest potential for valuation risk or quality issues. This shortens review cycles, lowers their review costs, and drives up the confidence they’ll have in their investment decisions,” continued Marshall.</p>
                    <p> ClearQC has been in beta-release since February, and is now generally available. The service is priced on a per report basis and hosted in Clear Capital’s secure data centers with full redundancy.

                    <p><strong>TRUCKEE, Calif.</strong> – <em><strong>August 7, 2012</strong></em> – Clear Capital (<a href="http://www.clearcapital.com">www.clearcapital.com</a>), a premium provider of real estate analytics and asset valuation, today released its Home Data Index™ (HDI) Market Report with data through July 2012. The HDI Market Report takes a broad array of public and proprietary data sources to provide the most timely and relevant analysis available. Report highlights include:</p>
                    <p>National home prices in July picked up the pace of growth over both the rolling quarter and year.</p>
                <div align="right" id="release2ButtonContainer">

                </div>
                <div id="release2Rest">
                    <p>The West extended run of leading gains, shifting growth to higher priced market segments.</p>
                    <p>MSAs continued to make progress overall, while potentially volatile trends emerged in some lower priced, hard hit markets.</p>
                    <p>One third of top metros posted double digit yearly gains, while bottom 15 metros generally saw prices stabilize.</p>
                    <p>“July home price trends continued to show promise at a time when the strength of the broader economy is in question on many fronts,” said Dr. Alex Villacorta, Director of Research and Analytics at Clear Capital. “The national housing market defied the drag of a softening economy with increasing gains of 2.0% over the last rolling quarter. Housing gains in the West continued to lead the nation, and more importantly, for the second month in a row, the price rebound has broken out of the low price tier segments into higher priced homes. As the pool of buyers expands, the West continues to position for the next phase of recovery.</p>
                    <p>“While significant risks remain at large, housing now has the potential to enter a positive feedback loop. Price increases could lead to increased confidence. This could motivate buyers, propelling the recovery in spite of the potential economic slowdown outside the housing market. Of course it’s still possible that housing could experience a pull back if contagion from other economic sectors bleeds through, but right now there appears to be a healthy level of resilience.”</p>
